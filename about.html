            <img class="thework" src="./src/public/thework.jpg" alt="theworksheet">
            <p>The Work is a simple yet powerful process of inquiry that teaches you to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause all the suffering in the world. It consists of four questions that you apply to a stressful thought. It’s a way to understand what’s hurting you, a way to end all your stress and suffering. It works for everyone who is open to it, and it has a profound effect on your whole life.” </p>
            <p>It is accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds and can be applied to any area of your life. Everything you need to do The Work is available for free on <a href="https://thework.com/">thework.com.</a> </p>
            <p>Whether you are already familiar with The Work and require someone to hold the space for you or are entirely new to the process and require some support in getting started, <a href=".contact.html">contact me to book a session.</a></p>
            <!-- <p>Since being introduced to <a href="https://thework.com/">The Work</a> in 2014, I have attended several events with Byron Katie and participated in multiple Work sessions which have helped to deepen my own practice.</p>
            <p>Ever since incorporating the practice of The Work in my daily life I have noticed a deeper sense of calm within me. My life, although not challenge free, seems to flow more effortlessly and I am now able to move forward with more courage.</p> -->
            <p>The basic approach and what to expect in a session:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify a specific situation in your life that is causing you stress.</li>
                <li>Write down your stressful thoughts about the situation on a <a href="">Judge Your Neighbour</a></li>
                <li>I facilitate you by asking you the four questions in relation to one of your stressful beliefs. </li>
                <li>Lastly we explore the turnarounds. </li>
            </ol>
