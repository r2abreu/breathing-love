            <h1>10 Day Vipassana Medidation Course</h1>
            <p>I first heard about Vipassana at the age of eighteen during my first year at University. I didn’t know too much about it, but I was intrigued and remember thinking that I would return to it in the future when the time was right. </p>
            <img class="thework" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/fl_progressive,q_auto,w_1024/5e32133c101dd3001c59e215.jpg" alt="buda-flowers">
            <p>My intention for attending this ten day course, eight years down the line, was to exercise my discipline and finally immerse myself more fully in meditation. A practice I had spent more time reading and researching about than experiencing first hand. </p>
            <p>It was definitely one of, if not the most challenging experience of my life. What kept me going was the radical promise I had made to myself to complete the course with absolute dedication, as well as my ego refusing to leave and go against the agreement I had made upon my arrival to stay for the entire duration, and finally the fellow attendees whose mere presence and perseverance to their own practice encouraged me to follow through. There was a young woman in particular who was seated next to me during the course, and who helped me in moments of wanting to give up. I remember thinking she must have been very experienced, perhaps even a returning student, only to find out at the end that she had never meditated before.</p>
            <p>I had vivid dreams during my stay, however there was one dream in particular that left an impression on me. I was in a large, multi-level, beautiful home, with white interiors. It was situated in a warm climate, as I remember large windows and ceiling fans. I opened the front door as I heard a rustle outside. Intruders pushed open the door and forcefully came into the house, carrying guns. My first instinct was to run to the living room and shield my mother from harm. I held her and threw my body onto hers so the intruders would kill me instead of her. However, they shot my mother and she died in my arms. In that moment there was a realisation that I had ‘wasted’ all my life trying to win her approval instead of simply loving her, and appreciating her and giving of myself to her in the name of love. Upon waking up this definitely made me reflect on how I live my life. It was a distressing dream, but I was very thankful for its message.</p>
            <p>I didn't get to introduce myself to my roommate before taking a vow of silence, and so I shared my room with someone whose sound of voice I hadn’t heard, whose name I didn’t know, and whose story was a complete mystery. Eye contact was the only form of communication we exchanged inadvertently a few times. Upon breaking our silence, I was very excited to speak with her. I remember missing laughter so much during my noble silence, and that paired with her incredible sense of humour had me in fits of laughter and tears which was such a joy. She is an incredible woman, with insatiable energy and goodwill. I feel very fortunate to have shared such a special time with her, and in some of my darkest moments, her presence served as comfort and reassurance. </p>
            <p>As part of the code of discipline participants are asked to observe noble silence, and to discontinue food outside of meal-time, alcohol, exercise (other than walking), reading, writing, music, sexual activity and technology, amongst other things. This is to minimise distraction and to help develop concentration of the mind. Having all the above removed from my day-to-day life was a challenge to say the least. There was absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to go but simply be with myself (with my mind) and turn my attention inwards. The radical decrease of external stimuli paired with the Anapana technique during the first few days made my mind increasingly sensitive and focused. What I noticed during this time was that all my thoughts were being recycled, there was no new stimuli to attach or cling to, there was no problem in the outside world, and so I was able to observe the recycling/repeating of the same belief patterns. I realised how anything outside of me, things, people are merely objects my mind uses to blame, judge and create so called problems. Another way to put this is that no one or nothing outside of me can possibly ever be my problem, cause me sadness, anger, etc. that is only mind/thought. </p>
            <p>This realisation was definitely a pinnacle moment for me. Although I had read about deviations of this from different spiritual texts nothing did or will ever come close to direct experience. Wisdom gained from personal experience is true knowledge. That was the biggest teaching I got from this course. I have spent countless years, reading, researching and although that time has surely not gone to waste, it cannot compare to experiencing truth for oneself. That is how true, radical and lasting shifts happen and can happen in the psyche. All else points to the truth but is not the truth itself. </p>
            <p>What I found most challenging was abstaining from prayer. Prayer, in the past has taken me out of some of my darkest moments. Any and every crutch was stripped away from me, I was left bare. It definitely pointed me to a greater inner strength, and showed me my capacity and capability. At the same time I realised the importance of prayer for me, a connection to something greater than me. My view is that we are not supposed to walk this path alone, we have a higher presence/power we can tap into at any moment for guidance, reassurance and strength. Vipassana doesn’t condemn forms of prayer or worship but invites attendees to experience Vipassana in its purity. </p>
            <p>Vipassana means to see things as they are. To observe reality as it is. By observing the sensations of the body, one observes the truth of mind as they are interconnected. I found it so fascinating how such a simple technique can be a doorway to accessing deeper layers of the mind.

            <p>During one evening I felt an intense ball of fire in my chest, a burning sensation so powerful I thought I was going to implode. I had absolutely no choice, no way out but in and it finally subsided. The practice of Vipassana showed me how I try to avoid pain and fear and in doing so I end up suffering more. However, by surrendering and observing the pain, what I’m afraid of isn’t so scary after all, and at the same time incredibly empowering. As summarised by Haruki Murakami <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running" target="_blank"><q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running">Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.</q>  </a> </p>
            <p>I came into this experience very naive of how profound it would be. I came in with the intention to finally exercise discipline and devotion to something (meditation) I believed in the benefits of. However, what I experienced was so much more profound and radical. It wasn’t a beautiful or blissful experience, at least it wasn’t for me. It really felt I went to hell and back, which was essentially being faced with my deepest fears. I had nowhere to hide or run to but face them and sit with them. It was so difficult and equally such a blessing. I was so taken aback by how I was able to tap into my subconscious mind by merely observing bodily sensations. Upon reflection, I was able to also see more clearly how the subconscious does in fact operate as a result of our programming. We are essentially a software that needs to be re-written.</p>
            <p>It was so incredible and enriching to hear about the experiences and insights of the other participants. It was a beautiful way to integrate and conclude the course. No two experiences were the same. </p>
